The database could not be published to github so i had to zip and publish it that way. 
The database is placed in project HotelFrontOffice an zip file is called app_data. 
so for things to work we need app_data directory with panda.mdf file. 

The Testing code also look at the same location. 
I adjusted code in GetFileName is Dataconnection class to do that.
